# Green Dev Dashboard ðŸŒ± 

This project visualizes the carbon footprint of software development activities, helping developers and teams make more sustainable choices. It collects data from **GitHub Actions**, calculates green software metrics (**COâ‚‚ emissions, energy consumption**), and displays them in an interactive dashboard. 
In this project, CO2 emission is estimated using simplified version of **Software Carbon Intensity** (SCI) specification by **Green Software Foundation** (GSF). The dashboard is currently hosted on AWS EC2, check out http://18.185.23.135/.

## Features

* Fetches and displays metrics such as:

  * Repository name
  * Commit hash
  * Duration of run
  * Energy consumed
  * Estimated COâ‚‚ emissions
  * Timestamp of the activity
* Clean and minimal UI built with **React**
* API endpoint served via a **Node.js** or compatible backend (local or tunneled using **ngrok**)

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: React + Tailwind CSS
* **Backend**: Node.js / Express (or compatible) serving `/api/green-metrics`
* **Tunneling**: Ngrok (used for public API access during development)


## To Get Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/malihanawshin/Develop_Greenly.git
cd green-dev-dashboard
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the Frontend

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Start Backend Server (if not already running)

Ensure your backend is running locally and exposes the `GET /api/green-metrics` endpoint.

Example:

```bash
node server.js
```

### 5. Tunnel with Ngrok (optional)

To allow frontend access to a locally running API server:

```bash
npx ngrok http 3000
```

Update your `fetch()` URL in `Dashboard.jsx` with the generated ngrok URL:

```js
const response = await fetch('https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app/api/green-metrics');
```
